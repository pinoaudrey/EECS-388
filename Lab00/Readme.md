# EECS388 Embedded Systems Lab Fall 2021

Welcome to Embedded System Lab! In EECS388 labs, you will learn how to use microcontrollers and embedded processors for interacting with the physical environment using I/O devices.

## Get Started
To get started with the labs you need to first clone your repo (replace you KUOnlineID with your online ID):
```sh
$ git clone git@git.eecs.ku.edu:eecs388-Fa2021/student-repos/KUOnlineID.git
```

To fetch the branch correspondig to a week's Lab:
```sh
$ cd KUOnlineID
$ git fetch; git checkout labXX
```

To push your local modifications to the remote repository:

```sh
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Final Commit-LabXX"
$ git push origin labXX
```

If multiple commits have the message "Final Commit-LabXX," the latest commit will be graded. A student will have until the start of their next lab section to submit their code (e.g., If your lab section is 8:00 AM Monday, you will have until 7:59 AM Monday of the following week). 

## After-Hour Lab Access
Each student is assigned a key code that they can use to access the lab after the advertised lab hours to finish their assignments. You can check your GTA or SI to attend their office hour in the lab. 

## Late Submission
If a student fails to submit her/his final version of the code before the deadline, the student is still able to submit the code with a penalty taken off that lab grade. The penalty for late lab submission is 10% per late day. Assuming that your submission deadline is on Monday at 7:59 AM, the table below shows a few scenarios for a better understanding of the daily 10% penalty:

| Submission time | Maximum possible grade (out of 100%) |
| ------ | ------ |
| 8:01 AM Monday | 90% |
| 6:00 PM Monday | 90% |
| 7:59 AM Tuesday | 90% |
| 8:01 AM Tuesday | 80% |
| 10:00 AM Thursday | 60% |
| 08:01 AM Wednesday the other week | 0% |

## Academic misconduct
Students should not share their homework, lab code, and lab report with others or copy other students' code or report. In the case of plagiarism, we follow the university policy for academic misconduct described in Article 3r, Section 6, of the Schoolâ€™s Rules and Regulations: https://policy.ku.edu/sites/policy.ku.edu/files/SoE_RulesRegs_Sept_2017.pdf 

## Attendance policy
You should not physically attend the labs if you have tested positive for COVID-19. You should inform your GTA or the instructor before hand if you have to skip a lab session.
